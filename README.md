# RSPt Tutorial
Here I will store the material used for the video tutorial on electronic structure calculations with FP-LMTO code "RSPt".

To know more about this code, visit:

In this series of tutorials I make step-by-step calculations using RSPt, explain how to prepare the input-files and what parameters are important to check in the out-files.

List of tutorials:
1) Setting up the crystal structure (Example: Co2FeAl)
2) Setting up the calculation (Example: Co2FeAl)
3) Running self-consistent calculation (Example: Co2FeAl)
4) Adding states to the core & spin-polarized core calculations (Examples: Co2FeAl & hcp Gd)
5) Adding Hubbard U: LDA+U vs LSDA+U calculations (Example: NiO)
6) Plotting the band structure (Example: Co2FeAl)
7) Calculation of the inter-atomic exchange parameters Jij's (Examples: Co2FeAl, NiO, hcp Tb)

Disclaimer:
In these examples, I also give some general recomendations about setting up the calculations. These are mostly based on my discussions with colleagues as well as my own experience. Certain settings related to the choice of kinetic energy tails and linearization energies are not carved in stone, but usually help to mitigate most of convergence issues.
